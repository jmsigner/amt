}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\verb{[track_xyt,steps_xyt]}\cr A track or steps.}

\item{...}{Further arguments, none implemented.}

\item{include.crepuscule}{\verb{[logical(1)=TRUE]}\cr Should dawn and dusk be included.}

\item{where}{\verb{[character(1)="end"]\{"start", "end", "both"\}} For \code{steps}, should the start, end or both time points be used?}
