# Version 0.1.7
## Round 1

I was asked to fix warnings that occured on one specific test environment: 

> checking whether package ‘amt’ can be installed ... [38s/38s] WARNING
Found the following significant warnings:
  Warning: multiple methods tables found for ‘direction’
  Warning: multiple methods tables found for ‘gridDistance’
  
using platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit) [https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macos-x86_64/amt-00check.html]

It seems that this issue is resolved, if packages `raster` and `terra` are newly installed, this was suggested by Roger Bivand here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70674136/r-package-warning-multiple-methods-tables-found-for-direction/70716776#70716776
